# TelePoint database backup

There are three ways to keep a safe copy of the portal database. **Pick the one
that matches what you want:**

| You want… | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| A copy **emailed to your inbox every day** (all customers, all details) | **Method 3** below |
| A versioned copy committed into this repo every 12 h | Method 1 (GitHub Actions) |
| A live mirror inside a Google Sheet | Method 2 (Google Sheets) |

All three read from the same secured endpoint, `GET /api/backup` (code in
`app/api/backup/route.ts`), gated by the `BACKUP_TOKEN` secret — set that once
(see Method 1, step 1) and any of the methods will work.

---

# Method 1 (recommended): GitHub Actions → repo

A scheduled GitHub Action runs **every 12 hours**, pulls every table from
`/api/backup`, and commits the data as JSON + CSV into `backups/latest/`. The
repo always holds a complete recent copy, and git history preserves every
previous snapshot for point-in-time recovery.

```
Portal DB  ──/api/backup──▶  GitHub Action (12-hour cron)  ──▶  backups/latest/*.json + *.csv (committed)
```

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/backup.yml` | The scheduled workflow (runs every 12 h). |
| `backup/github-backup.mjs` | Node script that pulls the tables and writes the files. |
| `backups/latest/` | The most recent snapshot (one JSON + one CSV per table). |
| `backups/backup-manifest.json` | Last run time + per-table row counts. |

## Setup (one time)

1. **Server token** — generate a long random secret and set it on the portal:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```
   Add it as an environment variable `BACKUP_TOKEN` (e.g. Vercel → Project →
   Settings → Environment Variables) and redeploy. Until it's set the endpoint
   returns `401` for everyone (fail-closed).
2. **Repo secrets** — in GitHub: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   → New repository secret**, add two:
   | Secret | Value |
   |--------|-------|
   | `PORTAL_URL` | `https://your-portal.vercel.app` (no trailing slash needed) |
   | `BACKUP_TOKEN` | the same secret you set on the server |
3. That's it. The workflow runs automatically every 12 hours. To run it now,
   go to the **Actions** tab → **Database backup** → **Run workflow**.

## How it behaves

- **Frequency:** every 12 hours (`cron: '0 */12 * * *'`), plus on-demand from
  the Actions tab. To change it, edit the `cron` line in the workflow.
- **Full refresh:** each run rewrites `backups/latest/` from the current DB, so
  there are never stale leftovers. A commit is only made when something changed.
- **History:** every changed snapshot is its own commit, so you can recover any
  past state from git (`git show <commit>:backups/latest/customers.csv`).
- **All details:** every column of every whitelisted table is written. `jsonb`
  / array columns are stored as JSON text in the CSV and as real JSON in `.json`.
- **Tables mirrored:** `retailers`, `customers`, `emi_schedule`,
  `payment_requests`, `payment_request_items`, `fine_settings`,
  `broadcast_messages`, `audit_log`. To add/remove tables, edit the whitelist
  in `app/api/backup/route.ts` — the script picks up the manifest automatically.

## Verify

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <BACKUP_TOKEN>" https://your-portal/api/backup
# → {"generated_at":"…","tables":[{"table":"customers","count":1234}, …]}
```

## Security notes

- The endpoint is **fail-closed**: no `BACKUP_TOKEN` configured → `401`.
- Treat `BACKUP_TOKEN` like a password — it grants read access to all
  backed-up tables. Rotate it by changing the value on both the server and the
  GitHub repo secret.
- Prefer the `Authorization: Bearer` header (used by the script) over the
  `?token=` query form, which can leak into logs.

# Method 2 (optional): Google Sheets mirror

This folder sets up an **automatic mirror** of the portal database into a
Google Sheet. A Google Apps Script polls a secured backup endpoint on the
portal and refreshes one tab per table **every 12 hours**, including all
historical rows. If anything ever happens to the database, the sheet is a
complete, recent copy.

```
Portal DB  ──/api/backup──▶  Apps Script (12-hour timer)  ──▶  Google Sheet (1 tab/table)
```

> **Why 12 hours and not every minute?** The original setup ran every minute.
> At that rate the script makes ~11,500 `UrlFetchApp` calls a day, which blows
> past Google's daily quota — after which every call fails and the sheet
> **silently stops updating** (the "backup not working" symptom). Running twice
> a day (16 calls/day) stays well within quota and is plenty for a safety
> backup. If you previously installed the 1-minute version, just re-run
> `setupTrigger` once — it removes the old trigger and installs the new one.

Files: `telepoint-backup.gs` (the Apps Script) and `GEMINI_PROMPT.md` (a prompt
that regenerates it). This method needs the same server `BACKUP_TOKEN` from
Method 1 — set that first if you haven't.

## One-time Google Sheet setup

1. Create a new Google Sheet (this becomes the backup workbook).
2. **Extensions → Apps Script**. Delete the placeholder `Code.gs` content and
   paste in `telepoint-backup.gs` (or let Gemini generate it — see
   `GEMINI_PROMPT.md`).
3. **Project Settings (gear icon) → Script properties → Add script property**,
   add two:
   | Property | Value |
   |----------|-------|
   | `PORTAL_URL` | `https://your-portal.vercel.app` (no trailing slash needed) |
   | `BACKUP_TOKEN` | the same secret you set on the server |
4. Back in the editor, select the function **`setupTrigger`** and click **Run**.
   Approve the authorization prompt the first time. This:
   - installs a time trigger that runs `backupAll` **every 12 hours**, and
   - performs an immediate first full sync.
5. Open the sheet — you'll see one tab per table plus a `_sync_status` tab
   showing the last sync time and per-table row counts.

## How it behaves

- **Frequency:** every 12 hours (twice a day). This keeps the sheet within
  Google's UrlFetchApp quota so it never silently stops updating, while still
  being a fresh safety copy. Apps Script's `everyHours()` accepts
  `1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12` — 12 is the longest single-trigger interval.
- **No overlapping runs:** `backupAll` takes a script lock, so a manual run
  and a scheduled run can never collide and corrupt a tab mid-write.
- **Full refresh:** every run clears each tab and rewrites it from the current
  DB, so previously-collected rows and any edits/corrections are always
  reflected — no stale leftovers.
- **All details:** every column of every whitelisted table is written. `jsonb`
  / array columns are stored as JSON text.
- **Tables mirrored:** `retailers`, `customers`, `emi_schedule`,
  `payment_requests`, `payment_request_items`, `fine_settings`,
  `broadcast_messages`, `audit_log`. To add/remove tables, edit the `TABLES`
  array in the script **and** the whitelist in `app/api/backup/route.ts`.

## Stop / change syncing

- Run **`removeTrigger`** in the Apps Script editor to stop automatic syncing.
- Run **`backupAll`** any time for a manual on-demand sync.
- To change the cadence, edit `everyHours(12)` in `setupTrigger` (Apps Script
  supports `everyHours(1|2|4|6|8|12)`, or `everyMinutes(1|5|10|15|30)` for more
  frequent — but watch the daily quota note above).

## Want more frequent / instant updates instead?

Every 12 hours is the reliable, quota-safe default for a safety backup. If you
later need *instant* updates on every write, the alternative is to push from the
server to the Google Sheets API using a service account on each create/approve.
That's more moving parts (a Google Cloud service account + the Sheets API
client) and is documented as a follow-up — ask and it can be added.

The same security notes from Method 1 apply: the endpoint is fail-closed, the
`BACKUP_TOKEN` is a password (here it lives in the Sheet's Script properties),
and the `Authorization: Bearer` header is preferred over `?token=`.

# Method 3 (recommended for you): daily email to your inbox

A small Google Apps Script pulls every table from `/api/backup` once a day,
packs them as CSV files into a single dated `.zip`, and **emails it to you** —
with `customers.csv` (all customers, every column) attached separately so you
can open it without unzipping. It sends to any address, including
Hotmail/Outlook, and needs no email provider or server change.

```
Portal DB ──/api/backup──▶ Apps Script (daily trigger) ──▶ 📧 your inbox (.zip + customers.csv)
```

File: `backup/telepoint-email-backup.gs`.

## Setup (one time, ~2 minutes)

1. Make sure the server `BACKUP_TOKEN` is set (Method 1, step 1).
2. Go to <https://script.google.com> → **New project** (or open the Apps Script
   project of your backup Sheet and add a new file).
3. Paste in the whole of `backup/telepoint-email-backup.gs`.
4. **Project Settings (gear) → Script properties → Add**, three properties:
   | Property | Value |
   |----------|-------|
   | `PORTAL_URL` | `https://your-portal.vercel.app` |
   | `BACKUP_TOKEN` | the same secret set on the server |
   | `BACKUP_EMAIL` | `kamfrens62@hotmail.com` (or wherever you want it) |
5. Select the function **`setupDailyEmailTrigger`** → **Run**, and approve the
   one-time authorization prompt. This installs the daily trigger **and sends
   one email immediately** so you can confirm it arrives.

## How it behaves

- **Frequency:** once a day, ~07:00 (script timezone). Change `atHour(7)` in
  `setupDailyEmailTrigger` to move it; run that function again to apply.
- **All details:** every column of every whitelisted table, all customers, all
  history — exactly what `/api/backup` serves.
- **Two attachments:** `telepoint-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.zip` (all tables as CSV) and
  `customers-YYYY-MM-DD.csv` (quick open).
- **Quota-safe:** one email/day is well within Google's free daily mail limit,
  and the script takes a lock so a manual run can't collide with the timed one.
- **Stop / run now:** run `removeDailyEmailTrigger` to stop; run
  `emailDailyBackup` any time for an on-demand copy.

Security notes from Method 1 apply: the endpoint is fail-closed, `BACKUP_TOKEN`
is a password (here it lives in the Script properties), and the script uses the
`Authorization: Bearer` header (not the `?token=` query form).
